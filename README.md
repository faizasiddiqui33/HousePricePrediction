# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and results for predicting housing prices using machine learning models. We compared the performance of four different models: 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), multiple regression, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).

## Key Findings
- The LSTM model outperformed other models, exhibiting the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values.
- Multiple regression also performed well, showing relatively low MSE and RMSE.
- SARIMAX and ARIMA models did not perform as well, with comparatively higher MSE and RMSE values.

## Results
My results suggest that the LSTM model is the most effective choice for predicting housing prices.

## Model Performance
- LSTM: Lowest MSE and RMSE, best overall performance.
- Multiple Regression: Good performance with relatively low MSE and RMSE.
- SARIMAX and ARIMA: Did not perform as well, with higher MSE and RMSE values.

Feel free to explore the code and results folders for a detailed understanding of each model's implementation and performance.
